    <h4>Hi, I'm Augusto Guerrero.</h4>
    <p>CS Student at daylight. Beer drinker at night. Coffee got me going, pizzas too. I like computers and stuff so I make this blog. Used to work at my university's Lab, now I'm lurking in my government's network as a Linux sysadmin. Free software as philosophy, GNU/Linux user. Java is the worse, word.</p>

    <p>I'm also available for hire as a freelance developer. <a href="contact">Talk to me</a> and tell me about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
