I mean, post. 

It's been a while since I wanted to have a static page site with my info and some work on it.

Then I find Jekyll, and github pages, which both are fantastic. So with a little research and learning, I find myself building this personal blog/contact page. It's based on a template called [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which I managed to modify to my liking. 

Basically it's not intended to have a periodical submit of posts, it was more of a project to learn web development from the ground up.

Occasionally I will be posting some stuff that I'm working on tho, like the pictures that I generated using google's deepdream algorithm.

I'm gonna do a write up of how it was generated in a future post. For now I'm working on make this whole site responsive as possible, so stay tuned for more.
